#About Project
This project involves developing a text generation model capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant paragraphs on specific topics based on user input. The model will utilize either a pretrained GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or a custom LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to generate human-like text.
The system will take a user prompt or topic as input and output several paragraphs of generated text that maintain logical flow, syntactic correctness, and thematic consistency.
Implement a generative text model using GPT (via Hugging Face Transformers) or build an LSTM-based model from scratch.
Train (or fine-tune) the model on a relevant dataset to enhance topic-specific generation.
Generate text based on user-specified prompts or keywords.
